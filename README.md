# JetBrains Academy

This is my public JetBrains Academy Project repository.

I'm currently completing the JetBrains Academy track Java for Beginners, which includes 15 different projects that vary in difficulty and completion time.

# Why?

After completing the Java Programming I course made freely available by the University of Helsinki on MOOC.fi, I decided I needed to put my knowledge into practice before continuing with the Java Programming II course. So, I put lots of effort trying to find the best place where I could get some inspiration and I found out about JetBrains Academy and their projects and decided to give it a go.
